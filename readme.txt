Codeflix, a streaming video startup, is interested in measuring their user churn rate. In this project, you’ll be helping them answer these questions about their churn:

1. Get familiar with the company.

How many months has the company been operating? Which months do you have enough information to calculate a churn rate?
What segments of users exist?
2. What is the overall churn trend since the company started?

3. Compare the churn rates between user segments.

Which segment of users should the company focus on expanding?
Start the following project, which will guide you through the queries you need to answer the above questions. Make sure to save your queries and results — you’ll be using them as well.

Then, create a set of slides using Google Slides, Microsoft Powerpoint, or some other presentation software. Your presentation should answer all of the questions listed above. Each answer should include a text explanation and data to support your claim. The queries used to find that data should be included in a separate .sql file.

Template: We recommend that you use the template linked here. This template contains examples of the types of slides you’ll want to use.
Rubric: You can share your work with your peers on Codecademy, who can give you feedback based on this rubric. Make sure to check your work before submitting!
